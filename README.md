## Okay sure but what actually is this and why?

Plasma (the KDE desktop environment, although KDE means the community and now I'm all confused again) used to have a moon phases applet. However, it never made the jump from 4 to 5. I attempted to see if I could port it, but I failed miserably, in part because I can't seem to get _any_ QML&C++ applet to run or install properly. So I figured I'd be better off just rewriting the whole damn thing in pure QML, which can be test-run easily with just "plasmoidviewer -a ." from within the "plasmoid" folder.
